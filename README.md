# elixir-coderep-python

This repo contains all of MCebisis' scripts - I have taken his first version and made my own version (codereppyt1.py, plots.py & models.py al;ong with the csv file in datasets folder) to try and create a version that works well for the Containers course and may be of use for the Software Testing group also.    

It takes inspiration from FastQC in that it produces graphics & text that can be inserted into an HTML doc that can be viewer in the users browser of choice or further processed e.g. with __pandoc__ to create a PDF file.   

codereppy_batch.py is a full implementation and codreppy_min_batch.py is a truncated minimal version.   

html_gen.py contains functions to be incorporated into codereppy1.py (and derivatives) to create html entries for its text and graphics outputs.  
html_test.py (along with test_image.png file) was used to test the functions in html_gen.py.
